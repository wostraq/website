<h3>Post-operative nausea and vomiting</h3>
Our first project began in January 2018 and looks at postoperative nausea and vomiting in the West of Scotland.<br>
This project also gave us an opportunity to test the network.<br>
Over the region, we collected data on over 300 patients. This would not have been possible without the help of our regional data collectors:<br><br>
